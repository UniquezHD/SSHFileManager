# SSHFileManager

i was using Teamviewer to transfer files to my raspberry pi but ended up having to pay so i switched to anydesk but at somepoint that stopped working and after that i used vncviwer and then somehow that stopped working so i got fed up and made my own filemanager with filezilla inspired ui to transfer files
it only has the things i needed at that point but i will at some point finish the project
